        saving strays philippines is a heart-led grassroots movement built to give stray animals a fighting chance. since 2023, 
        they’ve been on a mission to bust stray animal stigma, spark volunteerism, and find humane, sustainable ways to care for strays all over the country.

      cats of sorrento is a passionate, volunteer-led community in sorrento oasis, pasig city, where residents come together to care for stray cats. 
      in 2023, they became the first community to join the savingstrays™ campaign and development program, serving as the pilot group and 
      inspiring others to take action for animal welfare.

      this is torta, the little survivor who inspired our story.<br>
      torta went missing for several days. when she was finally found, she had serious injuries. vets had to remove her eye, but not her spirit.
      despite everything, torta stayed sweet and affectionate, now she is adopted by a loving family. she is the heart of Rescued Hearts. you meet a stray, grow attached, and face hard choices about their future.

      <p>
      and it just clicked.<br>
      we shared stories and found a shared love for animals that turned this project into something bigger than just a visual novel.
      rescued hearts is our love letter to the strays we’ve met, the rescuers we celebrate, and to everyone who believes every stray
      deserves a chance, every voice can make a difference, and every act of kindness matters.
